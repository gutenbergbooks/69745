INTRODUCTORY NOTE.


Here, O Public! here they are! You have been clamoring in the most
importunate and flattering fashion for a re-issue of the Cartoons of
_Grip_, and out of pure good humour, I have gone to work and _re-drawn_
them for you, because, you must know, these destiny-shaping pictures were
not originally engraved upon wood, but were produced by lithography,
and in due time each was utterly erased from the stone to make way for
bill-heads and cigar labels. This has been no light task, but of course
my good will towards men, together with the anticipation of being an
author and writing an “introduction,” made it a labour of love. Now, the
fact of the public request aforesaid will spare me the usual editorial
humiliation of an introductory apology; and I need say nothing here about
the subject matter of the sketches, as I have written an explanatory
note (comprehensive and lucid enough I hope) opposite to each, and,
therefore, my prefatory remarks are complete—with, by the way, a word to
the Critics. Dear Critics, I defy you to do your worst. This work, as you
know in your heart of hearts, is above criticism. There are no errata to
be found in the text, and no false perspective or other defects in the
drawings. If you hit upon anything that may persuade you to the contrary
pray don’t write it. Come and see me personally at No. 2 Toronto Street,
where I have hung my basket, and every Saturday croak “Never Say Die” to
an ever increasing circle of patrons. But what an ungrateful rook I am to
be sure, thus impudently chattering to those who have shown me nothing
but generosity during my career, and to be thus boring the generous
Canadian Public who have, with unexampled goodness, bestowed their
favours on

                           Their humble Raven,

                                                                     Grip.

“_Canada’s Farewell to Punshon._”


The departure of Rev. W. MORLEY PUNSHON for England, after a few years’
sojourn in Canada as President of the Wesleyan Conference, took place
on the 24th of May, 1873, (the day on which the first number of _Grip_
appeared.)

“_After the Session._”


On the 2nd April, 1873, Hon. L. S. Huntington, member for Shefford, from
his place in the House, charged Sir John A. Macdonald, Premier of the
Conservative Government, with having corruptly sold to Sir Hugh Allan,
of Montreal, the Charter of the proposed Canadian Pacific Railway, for
a large sum of money, which had been used as a Ministerial Bribery
Fund in the preceding General Election. Shortly after this, and before
any decided inquiry had been made into the matter, Parliament was
adjourned (on May 23rd,) until the following 13th of August. The Cartoon
playfully suggests the feeling of the Opposition, (represented by Hon. A.
Mackenzie,) towards the accused ministry during the “vacation.”

NO. 4.

“_Law and Justice._”


The advisability of removing the bronze statue of the Queen from the Park
had been under discussion in the City Council, and created considerable
interest. _Grip_, in this Cartoon, took the liberty of suggesting a work
of art to supply the place of Mr. Marshall Wood’s figure. The persons
represented are, in the centre, Mr. A. Macnab, Police Magistrate of
Toronto; on the right, Mr. Nudell, a popular Court official; and on the
left, Alderman John Baxter, J.P.

“_The Huntington Business._”


“Sir John courts enquiry” was the oft-repeated assertion of the
Conservative newspapers, in view of the approaching session of Parliament
at which the charge brought by Mr. Huntington was to be regularly tried.
The Cartoon was meant to depict the gallant Knight in his “courtship” in
such a way as to render the quoted statement “sorter Ironikal” as A. Ward
would say.

“_The Overworked Ma(yo)re._”


A palpable and surely a pardonable pun, seeing that its object was to
pay a tribute to the official industry of the Civic Chief Magistrate for
1873—Alex. Manning, Esq. A branch of the Society of the Prevention of
Cruelty, &c., had been established in the City shortly before the date of
the cartoon.

“_Canada’s Laocoon._”


An adaptation of the classical story of Laocoon and the serpents to
the circumstances of some of the parties to what was already known as
the “Pacific Scandal.” The persons represented are Sir Hugh Allan (to
whom the charter was sold), Sir John Macdonald (by whom ditto), and Sir
Francis Hincks. It is due to the latter gentleman to point out that, as
indicated in the cartoon, he was merely _suspected_ of complicity in the
matter, and most emphatically denied the truth of the allegation of his
guilt, made in some of the newspapers.

    When lo! two snakes (perhaps from the Yankee shore),
    Together trail their folds across the floor,
    With precious scandals reared in front they wind,
    Charge after charge, in long drawn length behind!
    While opposition benches cheer the while,

NO. 8.

“_Will he come to Grief?_”


The legend of this cartoon sufficiently explains its import. The
facetious occupation of the Clown had its analogue in the course pursued
by _The Globe_ during the “Scandal” excitement—an eager and justifiable
desire to see the hero of the business unseated.

“_Dufferin’s Tormentors._”


The Ministerial party in the House, headed by Sir John Macdonald were
exceedingly anxious for a prorogation of Parliament, the Opposition
as earnestly opposed that course. Their counter entreaties to the
Governor-General on the subject suggested the familiar scene of the
railway passenger and his friends the “cabbies.”

“_The Dainty Dish._”


A note here is perhaps superfluous. The faces of the “blackbirds” in the
“pie” are those of Hon. M. Langevin (a prominent member of the Macdonald
government), Sir Hugh Allan, Jas. A. Beaty, Esq. (to represent _The
Leader_), Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir Francis Hincks, “Uncle Sam,” and T.
C. Patteson, Esq. (representing _The Mail_ newspaper.) On Messrs. Blake
and Mackenzie devolved the task of presenting the savoury dish before
Parliament.

“_Whither are we Drifting?_”


General indignation was expressed throughout the country, when, in
accordance with the advice of the implicated Premier, Parliament was
prorogued and the investigation of the Scandal thus delayed. The words
imputed to Sir John in the cartoon had been used by him on the floor
of the House, and became a popular by-word while the discussion on the
subject lasted.

“_The Beauties of a Royal Commission._”


This Cartoon was intended to satirize the appointment by Sir John A.
Macdonald of a Royal Commission, absolutely under his own control,
to enquire into and report upon the charges brought by the Hon. Mr.
Huntington. The sentiment of the Press and public with regard to this
proceeding justified the implication of the caricature, that the accused
Premier was virtually “trying himself.”

“_Waiting for Huntington._”


Hon. Mr. Huntington refused to acknowledge the Royal Commission appointed
by the accused Minister, and declined to submit his case before it. The
motive imputed to him by the Conservative Press for this refusal was
fear, and in the eyes of his partizans Sir John sustained the attitude
represented in the Cartoon.

“_Wanted, a Good Stout Boy._”


There were those, of course, who saw an evidence of weakness in the
Governor-General’s use of his prerogative of prorogation in accordance
with the advice of the accused Ministers. But perhaps a “stouter boy”
would have done little better in that difficult and delicate case, and
certainly few “boys” could have done the work of the “place” generally
so as to secure more of the peoples’ respect and admiration than Lord
Dufferin enjoys.

“Illustrating,” as the legend goes on to say, “the recent great
opposition speeches, and the doings of the jolly Royal Commission.” The
Reformers, of course, lost no opportunity of painting Sir John in grimy
colours; while it was generally acknowledged that the Royal Commissioners
and the Conservative press did little more during the excitement than
“whitewash” him.

“_We in Canada seem to have lost all idea of justice, honour and

So said the _Mail_, the leading Conservative organ, on September 26th.
_Grip_ sought to point this lugubrious confession with an illustration
drawn from the topic of the hour.

Premier” may be seen, if the reader will take the trouble to peer into

The question which was on all lips during the interim between the

fixed for its re-assembling, October 23rd. The prophecy conveyed in the
unreasonable smallness of the hoop in the clowns hand, was duly realized.

“_A Case of Riel Distress._”


The murder of Thomas Scott, at Fort Garry, during the Red River
Rebellion, naturally excited great indignation throughout the Dominion,
and a universal demand was made for the apprehension and punishment of
Louis Riel, the leader of the malcontents, at whose instigation the deed
was committed. This righteous sentiment, however, ultimately resolved
itself into mere political “claptrap,” and the action of the Conservative
Government, then in power, was hypocritical throughout, they having
secretly promised the rebels an amnesty, while publicly professing an
anxious desire to “catch him.”

“_The Political Mother Hubbard._”


It had been currently reported in the newspapers that the dignity of
the Lieut. Governorship of Ontario was to have been bestowed on the
Hon. George Brown, immediately on the accession to power of the Reform
Government. The new ministers discovered, however, that Sir John
Macdonald, had, in the last gasp of his official life, appointed one of
his own colleagues, (the Hon. John Crawford) to the position in question,
besides disposing of ninety-nine other “places” in the gift of the First
Minister.

“_The Irrepressible Jack._”


The circumstance under which Sir John Macdonald was deposed from power
seemed to warrant the assumption of the Reformers that he was “done for.”
But on the contrary it only seemed the signal for additional honours to
be heaped upon him by the Conservative Party, who unhesitatingly chose
him leader of the opposition, and nominated him as member for Kingston,
West Toronto, &c., not to mention banquets, and other species of emphasis.

“_The Premier’s Model._”


In an address to the electors of Lambton, soon after the accession to
power of the Reform Party, Mr. Mackenzie declared the cardinal points of
the policy he would inaugurate, as leader, to be “Electoral Purity” and
“the Independence of Parliament.” (Before entering political life, Mr.
Mackenzie followed the vocation of stone-mason.)

“_The West Toronto Run._”


In the General Election which followed the defeat of the Conservative
Government, Mr. E. O. Bickford contested West Toronto in the interest
of the New Opposition, and rested his claims to the seat mainly on the
prestige of Sir John Macdonald, declaring that, if elected, he would
follow that honourable gentleman through weal or woe. As the cartoon
suggests, he met with defeat.

_Johnny’s “Turn;” or, New Year’s Joy._


The election of Mr. D’Arcy Boulton as Conservative Member for South
Simcoe, in the Ontario Legislature, took place about this time. Although
the influence of this event on the fortunes of the late Premier of the
Dominion was hardly discoverable, it was hailed by the Conservative Press
as the earnest of a reaction in favour of that party. A Mr. Saunders
(whose face our artist had not seen) was Mr. Boulton’s opponent in the
contest.

“_The Cruel Object of Dissolution._”


Mr. Mackenzie and his colleagues advised the dissolution of Parliament on
taking office. This was accordingly carried out, with the object, as the
cartoon suggests, of keeping Sir John and his comrades “out in the cold.”

    JANUARY 10th, 1874.

“_Never Out!_”


A Bill for the incorporation of the Orange Societies was at this time
occupying the attention of the Ontario Legislature, and creating
considerable interest. It was treated as a test question when it came to
the vote, and the Opposition anticipated the defeat of the Government,
who, by the way, opposed the measure. The decision of the umpire, after
the ball was bowled, is pictured in the cartoon.

    JANUARY 17th, 1874.

[Illustration: No. 33.

“NEVER OUT.”]




NO. 34.

“_The New Heathen Chinee._”


The analogy sought to be pointed out between the new Premier and Bret
Harte’s famous “Ah Sin” was merely in the possession of a great advantage
in the way of cards. Mr. Mackenzie went to the country with the “Pacific
Scandal” for a text, and it proved as ruinous to the Conservative Party
as Ah Sins “twenty-four packs” did to “Bill Nye” and his Pardner. This
explanation is needed, as the cartoon was considered, by some who
misunderstood it, to impugn the honesty of the gentleman represented.

“_‘Grip’s’ Valentine to Canada._”


The leading English and American Newspapers had been interested
spectators of the great Political Drama of the Pacific Scandal, and
joined in praising the purity and pluck exhibited by the Canadian people
in so promptly ejecting its authors from the high places they had
dishonoured.

“_The New Departure._”


Hon. Edward Blake’s withdrawal from the new Government very shortly after
it had taken possession of the Treasury Benches, created an unpleasant
sensation throughout the country. The hon. gentleman had been perhaps the
main instrument in bringing about the fall of the preceding Cabinet.

“_The Opposition Quartette._”


The most prominent members of the Opposition (Conservative) in the
Ontario Legislature were Messrs. M. C. Cameron, Q.C., J. Chas. Rykert,
A. W. Lauder and A. Boultbee. These gentlemen were always most active
and energetic in their labour of fault-finding, and at the time of the
Cartoon were ringing the changes on the public accounts of the Province,
which were undergoing examination in Committee.

notwithstanding, popularly looked upon as one of the most trustworthy and

“_A Question for Pay Day._”


The “Opposition Quartette” had vigorously assailed the action of the Hon.
A. McKellar for having, in his capacity as Minister of Public Works,
granted a half holiday (at the public expense) to the workmen engaged in
building the Central Prison at Toronto, to allow them an opportunity of
attending a nomination meeting in the West Division of the city. In view
of the meagre amount of work done on the left side of the Speaker during
the Session, “Grip’s” question was quite logical.

Louis Riel, the leader of the Red River Rebellion and alleged murderer of
Thomas Scott, had been returned for Provencher, Manitoba, to the Dominion
Parliament. He prudently failed to take his seat in the House, while the
unanimity with which both sides cried for his arrest made “the vacant
chair” a bond of union for the time being.

“_The Science of Cheek._”


A great sensation was caused throughout the country at the announcement
that Riel had actually appeared in the House at Ottawa and signed
the Members’ Roll. This he did _incog._, and immediately afterwards
disappeared. The cartoon anticipated his next step in the “Science of
Cheek.”

“_A Touching Appeal._”


On the accession of Mr. Mackenzie’s Government a large deficit in the
treasury was discovered. Mr. Cartwright, Finance Minister, in his Budget
speech, attributed this to the extravagance and corruption of the
preceding administration. A new tariff was issued, in which the duties on
various articles were raised considerably.

The new tariff proved very unpopular in many points, and the Finance
Minister was for several weeks fairly besieged by the representatives of
various branches of trade and commerce, who called to _protest_ against
the objectionable items.

“_Mrs. Gamp’s Home-Thrust._”


Early in the session a committee was appointed to inquire into the cause
of the North-West difficulties, and during the progress of the inquiry
evidence was elicited (mainly from Archbishop Tache) which implicated
Sir John A. Macdonald. The Reform Party is represented in the cartoon
as facetiously anticipating a repetition of the right hon. gentleman’s
famous asseveration of his innocence. (See Cartoon No. 11.)

incapacity.

this as a physical impossibility, and proposed, as the cartoon has it,
“to tak the distance in sensible like jumps, ye ken!”

  the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
  works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you “AS-IS”, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

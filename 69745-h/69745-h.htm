<p class="dropcap">Here, O Public! here they are! You have been clamoring in the most importunate
and flattering fashion for a re-issue of the Cartoons of <i>Grip</i>, and out
of pure good humour, I have gone to work and <i>re-drawn</i> them for you, because,
you must know, these destiny-shaping pictures were not originally engraved
upon wood, but were produced by lithography, and in due time each was utterly
erased from the stone to make way for bill-heads and cigar labels. This has been
no light task, but of course my good will towards men, together with the anticipation
of being an author and writing an “introduction,” made it a labour
of love. Now, the fact of the public request aforesaid will spare me the usual
editorial humiliation of an introductory apology; and I need say nothing here
about the subject matter of the sketches, as I have written an explanatory note
(comprehensive and lucid enough I hope) opposite to each, and, therefore, my prefatory
remarks are complete—with, by the way, a word to the Critics. Dear Critics, I defy you
to do your worst. This work, as you know in your heart of hearts, is above criticism.
There are no errata to be found in the text, and no false perspective or other defects in
the drawings. If you hit upon anything that may persuade you to the contrary pray
don’t write it. Come and see me personally at No. 2 Toronto Street, where I have
hung my basket, and every Saturday croak “Never Say Die” to an ever increasing
circle of patrons. But what an ungrateful rook I am to be sure, thus impudently
chattering to those who have shown me nothing but generosity during my career,
and to be thus boring the generous Canadian Public who have, with unexampled
goodness, bestowed their favours on</p>

“<i>After the Session.</i>”</h2>

</div>

<p>On the 2nd April, 1873, Hon. L. S. Huntington, member for
Shefford, from his place in the House, charged Sir John A.
Macdonald, Premier of the Conservative Government, with
having corruptly sold to Sir Hugh Allan, of Montreal, the
Charter of the proposed Canadian Pacific Railway, for a large
sum of money, which had been used as a Ministerial Bribery
Fund in the preceding General Election. Shortly after this,
and before any decided inquiry had been made into the matter,
Parliament was adjourned (on May 23rd,) until the following
13th of August. The Cartoon playfully suggests the feeling of
the Opposition, (represented by Hon. A. Mackenzie,) towards
the accused ministry during the “vacation.”</p>

“<i>Law and Justice.</i>”</h2>

<p>The advisability of removing the bronze statue of the Queen
from the Park had been under discussion in the City Council,
and created considerable interest. <i>Grip</i>, in this Cartoon, took
the liberty of suggesting a work of art to supply the place of
Mr. Marshall Wood’s figure. The persons represented are, in
the centre, Mr. A. Macnab, Police Magistrate of Toronto; on

<p>“Sir John courts enquiry” was the oft-repeated assertion of the
Conservative newspapers, in view of the approaching session of
Parliament at which the charge brought by Mr. Huntington
was to be regularly tried. The Cartoon was meant to depict
the gallant Knight in his “courtship” in such a way as to
render the quoted statement “sorter Ironikal” as A. Ward
would say.</p>

due to the latter gentleman to point out that, as indicated in
the cartoon, he was merely <i>suspected</i> of complicity in the

<p>This Cartoon was intended to satirize the appointment by
Sir John A. Macdonald of a Royal Commission, absolutely
under his own control, to enquire into and report upon the
charges brought by the Hon. Mr. Huntington. The sentiment
of the Press and public with regard to this proceeding justified
the implication of the caricature, that the accused Premier was

by the Conservative Press for this refusal was fear, and in the

<p>There were those, of course, who saw an evidence of weakness
in the Governor-General’s use of his prerogative of prorogation
in accordance with the advice of the accused Ministers. But
perhaps a “stouter boy” would have done little better in that
difficult and delicate case, and certainly few “boys” could have
done the work of the “place” generally so as to secure more

<p>The murder of Thomas Scott, at Fort Garry, during the Red

at whose instigation the deed was committed. This
righteous sentiment, however, ultimately resolved itself into mere
political “claptrap,” and the action of the Conservative Government,
then in power, was hypocritical throughout, they having
secretly promised the rebels an amnesty, while publicly professing
an anxious desire to “catch him.”</p>

“<i>The Political Mother Hubbard.</i>”</h2>

</div>

<p>It had been currently reported in the newspapers that the
dignity of the Lieut. Governorship of Ontario was to have been
bestowed on the Hon. George Brown, immediately on the
accession to power of the Reform Government. The new
ministers discovered, however, that Sir John Macdonald, had,
in the last gasp of his official life, appointed one of his own
colleagues, (the Hon. John Crawford) to the position in question,
besides disposing of ninety-nine other “places” in the gift of
the First Minister.</p>

“<i>The Irrepressible Jack.</i>”</h2>

</div>

<p>The circumstance under which Sir John Macdonald was
deposed from power seemed to warrant the assumption of the
Reformers that he was “done for.” But on the contrary it
only seemed the signal for additional honours to be heaped
upon him by the Conservative Party, who unhesitatingly chose
him leader of the opposition, and nominated him as member
for Kingston, West Toronto, &amp;c., not to mention banquets,
and other species of emphasis.</p>

earnest of a reaction in favour of that party. A Mr. Saunders
(whose face our artist had not seen) was Mr. Boulton’s opponent

<p>A Bill for the incorporation of the Orange Societies was at

and creating considerable interest. It was treated as a test

the defeat of the Government, who, by the way, opposed
the measure. The decision of the umpire, after the ball was
bowled, is pictured in the cartoon.</p>

Mackenzie went to the country with the “Pacific Scandal”
for a text, and it proved as ruinous to the Conservative Party
as Ah Sins “twenty-four packs” did to “Bill Nye” and his
Pardner. This explanation is needed, as the cartoon was considered,
by some who misunderstood it, to impugn the honesty
of the gentleman represented.</p>

“<i>A Touching Appeal.</i>”</h2>

</div>

<p>On the accession of Mr. Mackenzie’s Government a large
deficit in the treasury was discovered. Mr. Cartwright, Finance
Minister, in his Budget speech, attributed this to the extravagance
and corruption of the preceding administration. A new tariff
was issued, in which the duties on various articles were raised
considerably.</p>

</div>

<p>Early in the session a committee was appointed to inquire into
the cause of the North-West difficulties, and during the progress
of the inquiry evidence was elicited (mainly from Archbishop
Tache) which implicated Sir John A. Macdonald. The Reform
Party is represented in the cartoon as facetiously anticipating a
repetition of the right hon. gentleman’s famous asseveration of
his innocence. (See Cartoon No. 11.)</p>

<p>The Reform Government took up the Pacific Railway scheme,
but initiated a new policy with regard to it. Sir John Macdonald

and proposed, as the cartoon has it, “to tak the distance in
sensible like jumps, ye ken!”</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

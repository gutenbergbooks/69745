<p class="dropcap">Here, O Public! here they are! You have been clamoring in the most importunate
and flattering fashion for a re-issue of the Cartoons of <i>Grip</i>, and out
of pure good humour, I have gone to work and <i>re-drawn</i> them for you, because,
you must know, these destiny-shaping pictures were not originally engraved
upon wood, but were produced by lithography, and in due time each was utterly
erased from the stone to make way for bill-heads and cigar labels. This has been
no light task, but of course my good will towards men, together with the anticipation
of being an author and writing an “introduction,” made it a labour
of love. Now, the fact of the public request aforesaid will spare me the usual
editorial humiliation of an introductory apology; and I need say nothing here
about the subject matter of the sketches, as I have written an explanatory note
(comprehensive and lucid enough I hope) opposite to each, and, therefore, my prefatory
remarks are complete—with, by the way, a word to the Critics. Dear Critics, I defy you
to do your worst. This work, as you know in your heart of hearts, is above criticism.
There are no errata to be found in the text, and no false perspective or other defects in
the drawings. If you hit upon anything that may persuade you to the contrary pray
don’t write it. Come and see me personally at No. 2 Toronto Street, where I have
hung my basket, and every Saturday croak “Never Say Die” to an ever increasing
circle of patrons. But what an ungrateful rook I am to be sure, thus impudently
chattering to those who have shown me nothing but generosity during my career,
and to be thus boring the generous Canadian Public who have, with unexampled
goodness, bestowed their favours on</p>

“<i>After the Session.</i>”</h2>

</div>

<p>On the 2nd April, 1873, Hon. L. S. Huntington, member for
Shefford, from his place in the House, charged Sir John A.
Macdonald, Premier of the Conservative Government, with
having corruptly sold to Sir Hugh Allan, of Montreal, the
Charter of the proposed Canadian Pacific Railway, for a large
sum of money, which had been used as a Ministerial Bribery
Fund in the preceding General Election. Shortly after this,
and before any decided inquiry had been made into the matter,
Parliament was adjourned (on May 23rd,) until the following
13th of August. The Cartoon playfully suggests the feeling of
the Opposition, (represented by Hon. A. Mackenzie,) towards
the accused ministry during the “vacation.”</p>

<p>The advisability of removing the bronze statue of the Queen
from the Park had been under discussion in the City Council,
and created considerable interest. <i>Grip</i>, in this Cartoon, took
the liberty of suggesting a work of art to supply the place of
Mr. Marshall Wood’s figure. The persons represented are, in
the centre, Mr. A. Macnab, Police Magistrate of Toronto; on
the right, Mr. Nudell, a popular Court official; and on the left,

<p>“Sir John courts enquiry” was the oft-repeated assertion of the
Conservative newspapers, in view of the approaching session of
Parliament at which the charge brought by Mr. Huntington
was to be regularly tried. The Cartoon was meant to depict
the gallant Knight in his “courtship” in such a way as to
render the quoted statement “sorter Ironikal” as A. Ward
would say.</p>

to the circumstances of some of the parties to what was already
known as the “Pacific Scandal.” The persons represented
are Sir Hugh Allan (to whom the charter was sold), Sir John
Macdonald (by whom ditto), and Sir Francis Hincks. It is
due to the latter gentleman to point out that, as indicated in
the cartoon, he was merely <i>suspected</i> of complicity in the
matter, and most emphatically denied the truth of the allegation
of his guilt, made in some of the newspapers.</p>

perhaps a “stouter boy” would have done little better in that

righteous sentiment, however, ultimately resolved itself into mere
political “claptrap,” and the action of the Conservative Government,
then in power, was hypocritical throughout, they having
secretly promised the rebels an amnesty, while publicly professing
an anxious desire to “catch him.”</p>

<p>In the General Election which followed the defeat of the

West Toronto in the interest of the New Opposition, and
rested his claims to the seat mainly on the prestige of Sir
John Macdonald, declaring that, if elected, he would follow
that honourable gentleman through weal or woe. As the

about this time. Although the influence of this event on the
fortunes of the late Premier of the Dominion was hardly
discoverable, it was hailed by the Conservative Press as the
earnest of a reaction in favour of that party. A Mr. Saunders
(whose face our artist had not seen) was Mr. Boulton’s opponent
